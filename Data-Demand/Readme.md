This section of the repository will hold the results of the Data in Demand portion of the hackathon.

Goals: 

1. Define the most common types of genomic data needs for research study 
2. Define the current landscape. Where are those needs being met? How are they being met (public-access data? Sythetic data? Other)? Where are those needs most unfulfilled (i.e. what sorts of synthetic data would offer the biggest research bang for the coding buck)?

Some background reading:

* [Synthetic data generation — a must-have skill for new data scientists](https://towardsdatascience.com/synthetic-data-generation-a-must-have-skill-for-new-data-scientists-915896c0c1ae) - This is a general lay of the land with respect to synthetic data and how it is the food that all data scientists need to make progress. **It is not specific to genomics or biomedicine.** It is also only ten minutes or so to read through...

* [[15 Best Test Data Generation Tools In 2019](https://www.rankred.com/test-data-generation-tools/) - These might spark some inspiration for alternative ways we might generate synthetic genomic data. 

* [24 Ultimate Data Science Projects To Boost Your Knowledge and Skills (& can be accessed freely)](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/05/24-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/) - These are some examples of sythetic data sets in other fields that might be interesting. 

* [Heart Disease Prevalence from SyntheticMass](https://syntheticmass.mitre.org/dashboard/synthea/town/pct_heart_disease) - This group has generated sythetic census data for the state of Massachusetts. Here's one example for heart disease.

* [Public data and open source tools for multi-assay genomic investigation of disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4945830/) - This is a summary of public-access sources of genomics data. It will offer information on where there are gaps that synthetic data could fill.

* [Generation of Artificial FASTQ Files to Evaluate the Performance of Next-Generation Sequencing Pipelines](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0049110) - Here's our competition! Or at least the synthetic genomics data state of the art...

Do you have other ideas? Send them to me at [jhajian@broadinstitute.org](mailto:jhajian@broadinstitute.org) and I will add them to the git.
