## Goals

1. Generalize the read data generation workflow to make it possible to use more options of the NEAT Read Simulator toolkit (eg error models, coverage options etc). 

2. Extend the mutation spike-in workflow to make it possible to introduce other variant types than single nucleotide variants (SNVs).

## Proposed tasks

See the README about the workflows in the `workflows` directory for background details on each of the two relevant workflows.

### Read data generation

1. TBD

### More variant types

1. TBD
